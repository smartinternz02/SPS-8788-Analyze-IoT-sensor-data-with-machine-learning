Analyze IoT sensor data with machine learning
According to a study, there will be more than 55 billion IoT devices by 2025, up from about 9 billion in 2017. Machine learning for predictive capabilities is now integrated with
most industrial IoT platforms, such as IBM IoT For example, if a sensor detects excessive heat or vibration, it triggers an alert. If the same sensor is connected to the internet, 
then the data encountered by the sensor can also be leveraged to draw more insights and perform analytics for future use. In this project, i will build a model for sensor data 
using Auto AI and build a web application that is integrated to the model built. Any anomaly predicted from the sensor data coming from the IoT platform is displayed on the WebApp.
